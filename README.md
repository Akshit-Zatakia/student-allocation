"# project-management-student" 

This project was designed to practice all the skills I have gotten as a web-developer so far.

Description - The project is a web-app designed for teachers who want to create assignment or project for their students.
Function - Create and manage their project and assign them to students.
Future scope - The bigger picture of this web app is to allow any teacher to give his/her class at home. Moreover, this project remains scalable and can be used as a project management system
